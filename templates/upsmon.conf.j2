# CERTPATH - path to certificates (database directory or directory with CA's)
#
# When compiled with SSL support, you can enter the certificate path here.
#
# With NSS:
# Certificates are stored in a dedicated database (splitted in 3 files).
# Specify the path of the database directory.
#
# CERTPATH /etc/nut/cert/upsmon
#
# With OpenSSL:
# Directory containing CA certificates in PEM format, used to verify
# the server certificate presented by the upsd server. The files each
# contain one CA certificate. The files are looked up by the CA subject
# name hash value, which must hence be available.
#
# CERTPATH /usr/ssl/certs
#
# See 'docs/security.txt' or the Security chapter of NUT user manual
# for more information on the SSL support in NUT.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CERTIDENT - self certificate name and database password
# CERTIDENT <certificate name> <database password>
#
# When compiled with SSL support with NSS, you can specify the certificate
# name to retrieve from database to authenticate itself and the password
# required to access certificate related private key.
#
# CERTIDENT "my nut monitor" "MyPasSw0rD"
#
# See 'docs/security.txt' or the Security chapter of NUT user manual
# for more information on the SSL support in NUT.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CERTHOST - security properties for an host
# CERTHOST <hostname> <certificate name> <certverify> <forcessl>
#
# When compiled with SSL support with NSS, you can specify security directive
# for each server you can contact.
# Each entry maps server name with the expected certificate name and flags
# indicating if the server certificate is verified and if the connection
# must be secure.
#
# CERTHOST localhost "My nut server" 1 1
#
# See 'docs/security.txt' or the Security chapter of NUT user manual
# for more information on the SSL support in NUT.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CERTVERIFY - make upsmon verify all connections with certificates
# CERTVERIFY 1
#
# When compiled with SSL support, make upsmon verify all connections with
# certificates.
# Without this, there is no guarantee that the upsd is the right host.
# Enabling this greatly reduces the risk of man in the middle attacks.
# This effectively forces the use of SSL, so don't use this unless
# all of your upsd hosts are ready for SSL and have their certificates
# in order.
# When compiled with NSS support of SSL, can be overriden for host
# specified with a CERTHOST directive.


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FORCESSL - force upsmon to use SSL
# FORCESSL 1
#
# When compiled with SSL, specify that a secured connection must be used
# to communicate with upsd.
# If you don't use 'CERTVERIFY 1', then this will at least make sure
# that nobody can sniff your sessions without a large effort.  Setting
# this will make upsmon drop connections if the remote upsd doesn't
# support SSL, so don't use it unless all of them have it running.
# When compiled with NSS support of SSL, can be overriden for host
# specified with a CERTHOST directive.
